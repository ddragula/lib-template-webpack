# Changelog

## v0.2.0

### Changed
- UMD output renamed from `dist/lib-template-webpack.min.js` to `dist/lib-template-webpack.js`.
- Webpack config migrated to `webpack/cdn.config.mjs` and disabled minimization (CDN will minify).
- README updated to reflect new paths and config filename.
- Samples now reference `dist/styles/lib-template-webpack.css` and `dist/lib-template-webpack.js`.

### Added
- Extracted CSS to `dist/styles/lib-template-webpack.css` via `mini-css-extract-plugin`.
- CSS export added: `"./lib-template-webpack.css" -> styles/index.css` for ESM consumers.
- `webpack-remove-empty-scripts` to remove empty JS for CSS-only entries.

### Removed
- Old `styles/lib-template-webpack.css` in repo (replaced by built CSS in `dist/styles`).

### Internal
- `package.json` `main`/`exports.require` now point to non-minified UMD file.
